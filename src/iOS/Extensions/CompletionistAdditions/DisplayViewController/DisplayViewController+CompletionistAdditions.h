/**
 Extension that adds additional behaviour to a class that is originally part of GoMap.
 
 The implementation differs depends on where this extension is used:
 - In GoMap, the implementation of these methods is just empty.
 - In Completionist, the methods are implemented and have functionality.
 
 The header only exists one time, but has two implementation files, depending on the target.
 When changing something about this header, make sure to update both implementation files!
