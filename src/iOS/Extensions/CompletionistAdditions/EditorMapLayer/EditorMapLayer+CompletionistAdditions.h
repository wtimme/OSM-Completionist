/**
 Extension that adds additional behaviour to a class that is originally part of GoMap.
 
 The implementation differs depends on where this extension is used:
 - In GoMap, the implementation of these methods is just empty.
 - In Completionist, the methods are implemented and have functionality.
 
 The header only exists one time, but has two implementation files (`.m`), depending on the target.
 When changing something about this header, make sure to update both implementation files!
